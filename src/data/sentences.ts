// About section
export const sentencesAbout: string[] = [
  `I am passionate about design, from industrial design and architecture to branding and web design.`,

  `As a web developer, I primarily work with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, alongside various other frameworks and libraries. I am highly adaptable to different technologies and situations.`,

  `I have lived, studied, and worked in Greece, Spain (Barcelona), and the UK (Brighton). I am fluent in Greek, English, and Spanish, and have traveled to over 30 countries.`,

  `I used to have a rubber duck on my desk, but now it shares space with a Maneki-neko, the iconic Japanese lucky cat figurine. Together, they bring a mix of fun and good fortune to my workspace!`,

  `I don't drink coffee or tea—well, maybe tea a few times a year, but that's about it.`,

  `It has been designed and developed from scratch, without the use of any front-end UI libraries, frameworks, or templates. The only library used is a graphics library named <a href="https://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5.js</a>, that helped me with the 3D rubber duck.`,

  `It is yet another <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank">love letter to the Internet of the old</a>, the era of naïve (web) art, the era of the romantic amateur, the era of GeoCities. When did the web become so serious? I first discovered the magical world of the world wide web in the 90's and I hope I have captured a glimpse of that time. My design is also influenced by print publication layouts and the bold, graphic style of 90s MTV.`,

  `I call this style <i>frivobrutalism</i>, a fusion of playful, whimsical design with the raw, unapologetic aesthetic of brutalism.`,
