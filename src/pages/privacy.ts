<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>
  This website will store some information about your preferences on your
  own computer inside a tiny file called a cookie. A cookie is a small
  piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer
  or mobile device.
</p>
<p>
  The cookie allows the website to remember your actions or preferences
  over time. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer,
  and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.
  However, if you do this, you may have to manually adjust some
  preferences every time you visit a site, and some services and
  functionalities may not work.
</p>
<p>
  Most browsers support cookies, but you can set your browser to decline
  them and can delete them whenever you like. You can find instructions
  here for how you can do that on various browsers.
</p>
<p>This website uses cookies to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Identify you as a returning user and to count your visits in traffic
    statistics analysis.
  </li>
  <li>Remember your custom display preferences.</li>
  <li>
    Provide other usability features, including tracking whether you’ve
    already given your consent to cookies.

  it will provide you with a better browsing experience.
</p>
<p>
  The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally
  and is not used for any purpose other than those described here.
</p>

<h3>Session Cookies</h3>
<p>
  We use so-called cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or
  other storage technologies that are stored and stored on your device by
  the internet browser you use. These cookies process certain information
  about you on an individual basis, such as your browser or location data
  or your IP address.
</p>
<p>
  This processing makes our website more user-friendly, more effective and
  more secure, as the processing enables, for example, the reproduction of
  our website in different languages or the offer of a shopping cart
  function.
</p>
<p>
  The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b.) GDPR,
  provided that these cookies are used to process data for contract
  initiation or execution. If the processing does not serve to initiate or
  process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the
  functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1
  lit. f) GDPR. When you close your Internet browser, these session
  cookies are deleted.
</p>

<h3>Third Party Cookies</h3>

<p>
  Our website may also use cookies from partner companies with whom we
  work for the purpose of advertising, analysis or the functionality of
  our website. Please refer to the following information for details on
  this, in particular on the purposes and legal basis for processing such
  third-party cookies.
</p>

<h3>Possibility of Elimination</h3>

  You can prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by setting your
  internet browser. You can also delete cookies that have already been
  saved at any time. However, the steps and measures required for this
  depend on the specific Internet browser you are using. If you have any
  questions, please use the help function or documentation of your
  Internet browser or contact its manufacturer or support.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of so-called flash cookies, however, processing cannot be
  prevented via the browser settings. Instead you have to change the
  setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this
  also depend on the specific Flash player you are using.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, this
  may mean that not all functions of our website can be used to their full
  extent.
</p>

  remove or reject cookies in your browser’s settings. Please be aware

<p>
  The website may contain links to third-party websites and applications
  of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are
  not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the
  website, any information you provide to these third parties is not
  covered by this Privacy Policy, and I cannot guarantee the safety and
  privacy of your information.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>
  We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service
  provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin
  4, Ireland (hereinafter: Google). Through certification according to the
  EU-US Privacy Shield,Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data
  protection regulations when processing data in the United States.
</p>
<p>
  The Google Analytics service is used to analyse how our website is used.
  The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest
  lies in the analysis, optimisation, and economic operation of our site.
  Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or
  frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google
  server in the United States and stored there.
</p>
<p>
  However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymisation
  function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the
  EEA before it is transmitted to the US. The data collected in this way
  is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to
  our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used
  to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the
  internet in general.
</p>
<p>
  Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In
  addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data
  protection practices at its website, including options you can exercise
  to prevent such use of your data. In addition, Google offers an opt-out
  add-on in addition to further information.
</p>
<p>
  This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you
  further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our
  website. The add-on informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no
  information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google
  Analytics.
</p>
<p>
  However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us
  or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed in.
</p>

<h3>Email Contact</h3>
<p>
  If you contact us via email, the data you provide will be used for the
  purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to
  process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer
  it in full or at all.
</p>
<p>
  The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
  Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and
  there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an
  order or contract resulted from there.
